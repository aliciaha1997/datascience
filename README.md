# Alicia Ngoc Diep Ha's Portfolio
This repository is a collection of projects that covers:

1. Data Analysis and visualization
2. Machine Learning and AI techniques
3. Code challenges/Kaggle tasks

## What the folders are ##
The data sets for these projects are located in "*Data*" whilst the notebooks are in the folder "*Notebooks*". Pretty straightforward.

Also, the env folder is where the virtual environment and it's relative installations are located.

## 1. How to start ##
To start, you'll need to run the "**start.sh**" script to activate the virtual environment which has the necessary libraries. Additionally, it'll prepare Jupyter Notebook which majority of the projects will be prepared as.

## 2. How to run specific notebooks ##
Jupyter Notebook will launch in your web browser and it'll already be in the "*Notebooks*" directory. Simply click on a file, select "**Cell**" and in the dropdown, click "**Run all**" to execute the code.

Have fun!
